# Thai Kiosk App
This is a project for CSE 170
The reason I chose React over vanilla HTMl, CSS, or JS is mainly how much my app relies on similar elements throughout different pages. Rather than copying and pasting code, I transform mine into a component-based architecture that allows for similar components to be reused efficiently. This also allows for my app to be scalable and become a more complex UI.
